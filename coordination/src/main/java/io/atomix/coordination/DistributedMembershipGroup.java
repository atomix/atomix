/**
 * Provides a mechanism for managing group membership and remote scheduling and execution.
 * <p>
 * The distributed membership group resource facilitates managing group membership within the Atomix cluster.
 * Each instance of a {@code DistributedMembershipGroup} resource represents a single {@link GroupMember}.
 * Members can {@link #join()} and {@link #leave()} the group and be notified of other members {@link #onJoin(Consumer) joining}
 * and {@link #onLeave(Consumer) leaving} the group. Members may leave the group either voluntarily or due to
 * a failure or other disconnection from the cluster.
 * <p>
 * To create a membership group resource, use the {@code DistributedMembershipGroup} class or constructor:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   atomix.create("group", DistributedMembershipGroup.class).thenAccept(group -> {
 *     ...
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <b>Joining the group</b>
 * <p>
 * When a new instance of the resource is created, it is initialized with an empty {@link #members()} list and
 * {@link #member()} as it is not yet a member of the group. Once the instance has been created, the instance must
 * join the group via {@link #join()}:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   group.join().thenAccept(member -> {
 *     System.out.println("Joined with member ID: " + member.id());
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Once the group has been joined, the {@link #members()} list provides an up-to-date view of the group which will
 * be automatically updated as members join and leave the group. To be explicitly notified when a member joins or
 * leaves the group, use the {@link #onJoin(Consumer)} or {@link #onLeave(Consumer)} event consumers respectively:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   group.onJoin(member -> {
 *     System.out.println(member.id() + " joined the group!");
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <b>Remote execution</b>
 * <p>
 * Once members of the group, any member can {@link GroupMember#execute(Runnable) execute} immediate callbacks or
 * {@link GroupMember#schedule(Duration, Runnable) schedule} delayed callbacks to be run on any other member of the
 * group. Submitting a {@link Runnable} callback to a member will cause it to be serialized and sent to that node
 * to be executed.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   group.onJoin(member -> {
 *     long memberId = member.id();
 *     member.execute((Serializable & Runnable) () -> System.out.println("Executing on " + memberId));
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
