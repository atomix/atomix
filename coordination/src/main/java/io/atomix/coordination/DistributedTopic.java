/**
 * Facilitates persistent publish-subscribe messaging in the cluster.
 * <p>
 * The distributed topic resource provides persistent publish-subscribe messaging between instances
 * of the resource. Pub-sub messaging is implemented as commands that are logged and replicated via the
 * Raft consensus algorithm. When a message is {@link #publish(Object) published} to a distributed topic
 * the message will be persisted until it has been received by all instances {@link #subscribe(Consumer) listening}
 * to the topic.
 * <p>
 * To create a topic resource, use the {@code DistributedTopic} class or constructor:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   atomix.create("topic", DistributedTopic.class).thenAccept(topic -> {
 *     ...
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * The topic resource exposes two simple methods: {@link #publish(Object)} and {@link #subscribe(Consumer)}.
 * Resources may publish but not subscribe to the topic or subscribe but not publish to the topic. Messages are
 * only routed to the resource instance if a subscribe listener has been registered.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   topic.subscribe(message -> System.out.println("Received: " + message));
 *   topic.publish("Hello world!");
 *   }
 * </pre>
