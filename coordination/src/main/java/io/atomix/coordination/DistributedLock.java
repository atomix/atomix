/**
 * Provides a mechanism for synchronizing access to cluster-wide shared resources.
 * <p>
 * The distributed lock resource provides a mechanism for nodes to synchronize access to cluster-wide shared resources.
 * This interface is an asynchronous version of Java's {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock}.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   atomix.create("lock", DistributedLock::new).thenAccept(lock -> {
 *     lock.lock().thenRun(() -> {
 *       ...
 *       lock.unlock();
 *     });
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Locks are implemented as a simple replicated queue that tracks which client currently holds a lock. When a lock
 * is {@link #lock() locked}, if the lock is available then the requesting resource instance will immediately receive
 * the lock, otherwise the lock request will be queued. When a lock is {@link #unlock() unlocked}, the next lock requester
 * will be granted the lock.
 * <p>
 * Distributed locks require no polling from the client. Locks are granted via session events published by the Atomix
 * cluster to the lock instance. In the event that a lock's client becomes disconnected from the cluster, its session
 * will expire after the configured cluster session timeout and the lock will be automatically released.
