/**
 * Provides a mechanism for coordinating cluster-wide resources with a strong leader.
 * <p>
 * Leader election allows a set of distributed processes to coordinate access to and control over resources by
 * electing a single process to do work. This leader election implementation uses a consensus-based state machine
 * to automatically rotate leaders as necessary.
 * <p>
 * To create a leader election, use the {@code DistributedLeaderElection} resource class when constructing a resource
 * instance:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   DistributedLeaderElection election = atomix.create("election", DistributedLeaderElection::new);
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Leaders are elected by simply registering an election callback on a leader election resource instance:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   election.onElection(epoch -> {
 *     // do stuff...
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * The first election instance that registers an election callback will automatically be elected the leader.
 * If the elected leader becomes disconnected from the cluster or crashes, a new leader will automatically be
 * elected by selecting the next available listener. Thus, the oldest instance is always guaranteed to be
 * the leader.
 * <p>
 * When a leader is elected, the election callback will be supplied with a monotonically increasing election
 * number known commonly as an <em>epoch</em>. The epoch is guaranteed to be unique across the entire cluster
 * and over the full lifetime of a resource for any given election.

   * thread, use one of the many completable future callbacks:
   * <pre>
   *   {@code
   *   election.onElection(epoch -> {
   *     ...
   *   }).thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Waiting for election..."));
