/**
 * Thread context.
 * <p>
 * The thread context is used by Catalyst to determine the correct thread on which to execute asynchronous callbacks.
 * All threads created within Catalyst must be instances of {@link AtomixThread}. Once
 * a thread has been created, the context is stored in the thread object via
 * {@link AtomixThread#setContext(ThreadContext)}. This means there is a one-to-one relationship
 * between a context and a thread. That is, a context is representative of a thread and provides an interface for firing
 * events on that thread.
 * <p>
 * Components of the framework that provide custom threads should use {@link AtomixThreadFactory}
 * to allocate new threads and provide a custom {@link ThreadContext} implementation.
