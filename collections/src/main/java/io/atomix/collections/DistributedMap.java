/**
 * Stores a map of keys to values.
 * <p>
 * The distributed map stores a map of keys and values via an interface similar to that of {@link Map}.
 * Map entries are stored in memory on each stateful node and backed by disk, thus the size of the map is
 * limited to the available memory on the smallest node in the cluster. This map requires non-null keys but
 * supports {@code null} values. All keys and values must be serializable by a
 * {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.Serializer}. Serializable types include implementations of
 * {@link java.io.Serializable} or {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.CatalystSerializable}. See the
 * serialization API for more information.
 * <p>
 * A {@code DistributedMap} can be created either via the {@code Atomix} API or by wrapping a {@link CopycatClient}
 * directly. To create a map via the Atomix API, use the {@code getMap} factory method:
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   DistributedMap<String, String> map = atomix.getMap("foo").get();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Maps are distributed and are referenced by the map name. If a value is {@link #put(Object, Object)} in
 * a map on one node, that value is immediately available for {@link #get(Object) reading} by any other node
 * in the cluster by operating on the same map.
 * <p>
 * In addition to supporting normal {@link java.util.Map} methods, this implementation supports values
 * with TTLs. When a key is set with a TTL, the value will expire and be automatically evicted from the map
 * some time after the TTL.
 *
 * @param <K> The map key type.
 * @param <V> The map entry type.
