/**
 * Distributed map.
 * <p>
 * The distributed map resource provides an interface and behavior similar to {@link java.util.Map}.
 * <p>
 * To create a distributed map, use the {@link io.atomix.Atomix#create(String, Class)} or
 * {@link io.atomix.Atomix#get(String, Class)} method. Map instances are stateless and so there
 * is no effective difference between instances.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   DistributedMap<String, String> map = atomix.<DistributedMap<String, String>>create("map", DistributedMap.class).get();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * The map requires non-{@code null} keys but supports {@code null} values. All keys and values
 * must be serializable by a {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.Serializer}. Serializable types
 * include implementations of {@link java.io.Serializable} or {@link io.atomix.catalyst.serializer.CatalystSerializable}.
 * <p>
 * In addition to supporting normal {@link java.util.Map} methods, this implementation supports values
 * with TTLs. When a key is set with a TTL, the value will expire and be automatically evicted from the map
 * some time after the TTL.
 *
 * @param <K> The map key type.
 * @param <V> The map entry type.
