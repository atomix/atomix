/**
 * Distributed collection of unique values.
 * <p>
 * The distributed set is closely modeled on Java's {@link java.util.HashSet}. All methods present in the
 * {@link java.util.Set} interface are present in this interface. Set items are held in memory on each stateful node and
 * backed by replicated logs on disk, thus the size of a set is limited by the memory available to the smallest node in
 * the cluster. Internally, {@code DistributedSet} uses a {@link java.util.HashMap} to store set items in memory in the
 * replicated state machine.
 * <p>
 * To create a distributed set, use the {@code getSet} factory method: <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   DistributedSet<String> set = atomix.getSet("foo").get();
 *   }
 * </pre> All set modification operations are linearizable, so items added to or removed from the set will be
 * immediately reflected from the perspective of all clients operating on the set. The set is shared by processes based
 * on the set name.
 * <p>
 * Sets support relaxed consistency levels for some read operations line {@link #size(ReadConsistency)} and
 * {@link #contains(Object, ReadConsistency)}. By default, read operations on a set are linearizable but require some
 * level of communication between nodes.
 *
 * @param <T> The set value type.
