/**
 * Raft server cluster API.
 * <p>
 * This class provides the view of the Raft cluster from the perspective of a single server. When a
 * {@link RaftServer RaftServer} is started, the server will form a cluster
 * with other servers. Each Raft cluster consists of some set of {@link #getMembers() members}, and each
 * {@link RaftMember} represents a single server in the cluster. Users can use the {@code Cluster} to react to
 * state changes in the underlying Raft algorithm via the various listeners.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   server.cluster().onJoin(member -> {
 *     System.out.println(member.address() + " joined the cluster!");
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Membership exposed via this interface is provided from the perspective of the local server and may not
 * necessarily be consistent with cluster membership from the perspective of other nodes. The only consistent
 * membership list is on the {@link #getLeader() leader} node.
 * <h2>Cluster management</h2>
 * Users can use the {@code Cluster} to manage the Raft cluster membership. Typically, servers join the
 * cluster by calling {@link RaftServer#bootstrap(MemberId...)}  or {@link #join(MemberId...)},
 * but in the event that a server fails permanently and thus cannot remove itself, other nodes can remove arbitrary servers.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   server.cluster().onJoin(member -> {
 *     member.remove().thenRun(() -> System.out.println("Removed " + member.address() + " from the cluster!"));
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * When a member is removed from the cluster, the configuration change removing the member will be replicated to all
 * the servers in the cluster and persisted to disk. Once a member has been removed, for that member to rejoin the cluster
 * it must fully restart and request to rejoin the cluster. For servers configured with a persistent
 * {@link StorageLevel}, cluster configurations are stored on disk.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, members can be {@link RaftMember#promote() promoted} and {@link RaftMember#demote() demoted} by any
 * other member of the cluster. When a member state is changed, a cluster configuration change request is sent
 * to the cluster leader where it's logged and replicated through the Raft consensus algorithm. <em>During</em>
 * the configuration change, servers' cluster configurations will be updated. Once the configuration change is
 * complete, it will be persisted to disk on all servers and is guaranteed not to be lost even in the event of a
 * full cluster shutdown (assuming the server uses a persistent {@link StorageLevel}).
