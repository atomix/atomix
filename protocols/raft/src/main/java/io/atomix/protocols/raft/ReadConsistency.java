 * Consistency levels are used to dictate how queries are routed through the Raft cluster and the requirements for

  /**
   * Enforces sequential query consistency.
   * <p>
   * Sequential read consistency requires that clients always see state progress in monotonically increasing order. Note that
   * this constraint allows reads from followers. When a sequential {@link io.atomix.primitive.operation.OperationType#QUERY query}
   * is submitted to the cluster, the first server that receives the query will handle it. However, in order to ensure that state
   * does not go back in time, the client must submit its last known index with the query as well. If the server that receives the
   * query has not advanced past the provided client index, it will queue the query and await more entries from the leader.

  /**
   * Enforces linearizable query consistency based on leader lease.
   * <p>
   * Bounded linearizability is a special implementation of linearizable reads that relies on the semantics of Raft's
   * election timers to determine whether it is safe to immediately apply a query to the Raft state machine. When a
   * linearizable {@link io.atomix.primitive.operation.OperationType#QUERY query} is submitted to the Raft cluster with
   * linearizable consistency, it must be forwarded to the current cluster leader. For lease-based linearizability,
   * the leader will determine whether it's safe to apply the query to its state machine based on the last time it
   * successfully contacted a majority of the cluster. If the leader contacted a majority of the cluster within the last
   * election timeout, it assumes that no other member could have since become the leader and immediately applies the
   * query to its state machine. Alternatively, if it hasn't contacted a majority of the cluster within an election timeout,
   * the leader will handle the query as if it were submitted with {@link #LINEARIZABLE} consistency.

   * consistency, it must be forwarded to the current cluster leader. Once received by the leader, the leader will contact

   * leader is already in the process of contacting a majority of the cluster, it will queue the
   * {@link io.atomix.primitive.operation.OperationType#QUERY query} to be processed on the next round trip. This allows
   * the leader to batch expensive quorum based reads for efficiency.
