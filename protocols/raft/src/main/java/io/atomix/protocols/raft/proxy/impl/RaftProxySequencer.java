/**
 * Client response sequencer.
 * <p>
 * The way operations are applied to replicated state machines, allows responses to be handled in a consistent
 * manner. Command responses will always have an {@code eventIndex} less than the response {@code index}. This is
 * because commands always occur <em>before</em> the events they trigger, and because events are always associated
 * with a command index and never a query index, the previous {@code eventIndex} for a command response will always be less
 * than the response {@code index}.
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, the previous {@code eventIndex} for a query response may be less than or equal to the response
 * {@code index}. However, in contrast to commands, queries always occur <em>after</em> prior events. This means
 * for a given index, the precedence is command -> event -> query.
 * <p>
 * Since operations for an index will always occur in a consistent order, sequencing operations is a trivial task.
 * When a response is received, once the response is placed in sequential order, pending events up to the response's
 * {@code eventIndex} may be completed. Because command responses will never have an {@code eventIndex} equal to their
 * own response {@code index}, events will always stop prior to the command. But query responses may have an
 * {@code eventIndex} equal to their own response {@code index}, and in that case the event will be completed prior
 * to the completion of the query response.
 * <p>
 * Events can also be received later than sequenced operations. When an event is received, it's first placed in
 * sequential order as is the case with operation responses. Once placed in sequential order, if no requests are
 * outstanding, the event is immediately completed. This ensures that events that are published during a period
 * of inactivity in the session can still be completed upon reception since the event is guaranteed not to have
 * occurred concurrently with any other operation. If requests for the session are outstanding, the event is placed
 * in a queue and the algorithm for checking sequenced responses is run again.
