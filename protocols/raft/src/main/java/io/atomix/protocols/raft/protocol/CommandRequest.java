/**
 * Client command request.
 * <p>
 * Command requests are submitted by clients to the Raft cluster to commit commands to
 * the replicated state machine. Each command request must be associated with a registered
 * {@link #session()} and have a unique {@link #sequenceNumber()} number within that session. Commands will
 * be applied in the cluster in the order defined by the provided sequence number. Thus, sequence numbers
 * should never be skipped. In the event of a failure of a command request, the request should be resent
 * with the same sequence number. Commands are guaranteed to be applied in sequence order.
 * <p>
 * Command requests should always be submitted to the server to which the client is connected and will
 * be forwarded to the current cluster leader. In the event that no leader is available, the request
 * will fail and should be resubmitted by the client.
