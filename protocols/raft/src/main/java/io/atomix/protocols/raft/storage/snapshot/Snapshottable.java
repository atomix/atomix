/**
 * Support for periodically persisting {@link PrimitiveService} snapshots to disk.
 * <p>
 * To store a state machine's state, simply implement the {@link #snapshot(SnapshotWriter)} method and write the
 * complete state machine state to the snapshot via the {@link SnapshotWriter}. Raft will periodically invoke
 * the method to take a new snapshot of the state machine's state when the underlying log rotates segments.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   public class MyStateMachine extends StateMachine implements Snapshottable {
 *     private long counter;
 *
 *     public void snapshot(SnapshotWriter writer) {
 *       writer.writeLong(counter);
 *     }
 *
 *     public long increment(Commit<Increment> commit) {
 *       counter++;
 *     }
 *   }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Snapshot writing is only one component of snapshotting. Snapshottable state machines must also be able to
 * recover from snapshots stored on disk after a failure. When a server recovers from an existing Raft log,
 * the log will be replayed to the state machine, and when a point in logical time (an {@code index}) at which
 * a snapshot was taken and persisted is reached, that snapshot will be applied to the state machine via the
 * {@link #install(SnapshotReader)} method.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   public class MyStateMachine extends StateMachine implements Snapshottable {
 *     private long counter;
 *
 *     public void install(SnapshotReader reader) {
 *       counter = reader.readLong();
 *     }
 *   }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Implementations of the {@link #install(SnapshotReader)} method should always read precisely what implementations
 * of {@link #snapshot(SnapshotWriter)} write. State machines can potentially use a mixture of {@code SNAPSHOT}
 * and other commands, and state machine implementations should take care not to overwrite non-snapshot command
 * state with snapshots. For simpler state machines, <em>users should use either snapshotting or log cleaning
 * but not both</em>.

  /**
   * Takes a snapshot of the state machine state.

   * This method will be called each time the underlying {@link RaftLog Log}
   * rotates segments. Once the snapshot has been written, the snapshot will be stored on disk and eventually
   * completed. Note that snapshots are normally not immediately completed upon completion of this method as
   * servers must wait for certain conditions to be met before persisting a snapshot. Therefore, state machines
   * should not assume that once a snapshot has been written that the state machine can or will recover from
   * that snapshot. Snapshot writers should also ensure that all snapshottable state machine state is written on
   * each snapshot. Typically, only the most recent snapshot is applied to a state machine upon recovery, so no
   * assumptions should be made about the persistence or retention of older snapshots.
