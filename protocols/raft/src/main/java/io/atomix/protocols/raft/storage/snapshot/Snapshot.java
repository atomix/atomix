/**
 * Manages reading and writing a single snapshot file.
 * <p>
 * User-provided state machines which implement the {@link Snapshottable} interface
 * transparently write snapshots to and read snapshots from files on disk. Each time a snapshot is taken of
 * the state machine state, the snapshot will be written to a single file represented by this interface.
 * Snapshots are backed by a {@link io.atomix.storage.buffer.Buffer} dictated by the parent
 * {@link io.atomix.storage.StorageLevel} configuration. Snapshots for file-based storage
 * levels like {@link io.atomix.storage.StorageLevel#DISK DISK} will be stored in a disk
 * backed buffer, and {@link io.atomix.storage.StorageLevel#MEMORY MEMORY} snapshots will
 * be stored in an on-heap buffer.
 * <p>
 * Snapshots are read and written by a {@link SnapshotReader} and {@link SnapshotWriter} respectively.
 * To create a reader or writer, use the {@link #openReader()} and {@link #openWriter()} methods.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   Snapshot snapshot = snapshotStore.snapshot(1);
 *   try (SnapshotWriter writer = snapshot.writer()) {
 *     writer.writeString("Hello world!");
 *   }
 *   snapshot.complete();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * A {@link SnapshotReader} is not allowed to be created until a {@link SnapshotWriter} has
 * completed writing the snapshot file and the snapshot has been marked {@link #complete() complete}.
 * This allows snapshots to effectively be written and closed but not completed until other conditions
 * are met. Prior to the completion of a snapshot, a failure and recovery of the parent {@link SnapshotStore}
 * will <em>not</em> recover an incomplete snapshot. Once a snapshot is complete, the snapshot becomes immutable,
 * can be recovered after a failure, and can be read by multiple readers concurrently.
