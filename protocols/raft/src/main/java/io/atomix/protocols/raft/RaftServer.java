/**
 * Provides a standalone implementation of the <a href="http://raft.github.io/">Raft consensus algorithm</a>.
 * <p>
 * To create a new server, use the server {@link RaftServer.Builder}. Servers require
 * cluster membership information in order to perform communication. Each server must be provided a local {@link MemberId}
 * to which to bind the internal {@link io.atomix.protocols.raft.protocol.RaftServerProtocol} and a set of addresses
 * for other members in the cluster.
 * <h2>State machines</h2>
 * Underlying each server is a {@link PrimitiveService}. The state machine is responsible for maintaining the state with
 * relation to {@link OperationType#COMMAND}s and
 * {@link OperationType#QUERY}s submitted to the server by a client. State machines
 * are provided in a factory to allow servers to transition between stateful and stateless states.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   Address address = new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000);
 *   Collection<Address> members = Arrays.asList(new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000), new Address("123.456.789.2", 5000));
 *
 *   RaftServer server = RaftServer.builder(address)
 *     .withStateMachine(MyStateMachine::new)
 *     .build();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Server state machines are responsible for registering {@link OperationType#COMMAND}s which can be
 * submitted to the cluster. Raft relies upon determinism to ensure consistency throughout the cluster, so <em>it is
 * imperative that each server in a cluster have the same state machine with the same commands.</em> State machines are
 * provided to the server as a {@link Supplier factory} to allow servers to {@link RaftMember#promote(RaftMember.Type) transition}
 * between stateful and stateless states.
 * <h2>Storage</h2>
 * As {@link OperationType#COMMAND}s are received by the server, they're written to the Raft
 * {@link RaftLog} and replicated to other members
 * of the cluster. By default, the log is stored on disk, but users can override the default {@link RaftStorage} configuration
 * via {@link RaftServer.Builder#withStorage(RaftStorage)}. Most notably, to configure the storage module to store entries in
 * memory instead of disk, configure the {@link StorageLevel}.
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * RaftServer server = RaftServer.builder(address)
 *   .withStateMachine(MyStateMachine::new)
 *   .withStorage(Storage.builder()
 *     .withDirectory(new File("logs"))
 *     .withStorageLevel(StorageLevel.DISK)
 *     .build())
 *   .build();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Servers use the {@code Storage} object to manage the storage of cluster configurations, voting information, and
 * state machine snapshots in addition to logs. See the {@link RaftStorage} documentation for more information.
 * <h2>Bootstrapping the cluster</h2>
 * Once a server has been built, it must either be {@link #bootstrap() bootstrapped} to form a new cluster or
 * {@link #join(MemberId...) joined} to an existing cluster. The simplest way to bootstrap a new cluster is to bootstrap
 * a single server to which additional servers can be joined.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   CompletableFuture<RaftServer> future = server.bootstrap();
 *   future.thenRun(() -> {
 *     System.out.println("Server bootstrapped!");
 *   });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Alternatively, the bootstrapped cluster can include multiple servers by providing an initial configuration to the
 * {@link #bootstrap(MemberId...)} method on each server. When bootstrapping a multi-node cluster, the bootstrap configuration
 * must be identical on all servers for safety.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *     List<Address> cluster = Arrays.asList(
 *       new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000),
 *       new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000),
 *       new Address("123.456.789.2", 5000)
 *     );
 *
 *     CompletableFuture<RaftServer> future = server.bootstrap(cluster);
 *     future.thenRun(() -> {
 *       System.out.println("Cluster bootstrapped");
 *     });
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <h2>Adding a server to an existing cluster</h2>
 * Once a single- or multi-node cluster has been {@link #bootstrap() bootstrapped}, often times users need to
 * add additional servers to the cluster. For example, some users prefer to bootstrap a single-node cluster and
 * add additional nodes to that server. Servers can join existing bootstrapped clusters using the {@link #join(MemberId...)}
 * method. When joining an existing cluster, the server simply needs to specify at least one reachable server in the
 * existing cluster.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *     RaftServer server = RaftServer.builder(new Address("123.456.789.3", 5000))
 *       .withTransport(NettyTransport.builder().withThreads(4).build())
 *       .build();
 *
 *     List<Address> cluster = Arrays.asList(
 *       new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000),
 *       new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000),
 *       new Address("123.456.789.2", 5000)
 *     );
 *
 *     CompletableFuture<RaftServer> future = server.join(cluster);
 *     future.thenRun(() -> {
 *       System.out.println("Server joined successfully!");
 *     });
 *   }
