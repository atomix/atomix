/**
 * Support for listening for state changes in server sessions.
 * <p>
 * When implemented by a {@link PrimitiveService StateMachine}, this interface provides
 * support to state machines for reacting to changes in the sessions connected to the cluster. State machines
 * can react to clients {@link #onOpen(Session) registering} and {@link #onClose(Session) unregistering}
 * sessions and servers {@link #onExpire(Session) expiring} sessions.
 * <p>
 * {@link Session}s represent a single client's open connection to a cluster. Within the context of a session,
 * Raft provides additional guarantees for clients like linearizability for writes and sequential consistency
 * for reads. Additionally, state machines can push messages to specific clients via sessions. Typically, all
 * state machines that rely on session-based messaging should implement this interface to track when a session
 * is {@link #onClose(Session) closed}.

  /**
   * Called when a new session is registered.
   * <p>
   * A session is registered when a new client connects to the cluster or an existing client recovers its
   * session after being partitioned from the cluster. It's important to note that when this method is called,
   * the {@link Session} is <em>not yet open</em> and so events cannot be {@link Session#publish(PrimitiveEvent) published}
   * to the registered session. This is because clients cannot reliably track messages pushed from server state machines
   * to the client until the session has been fully registered. Session event messages may still be published to
   * other already-registered sessions in reaction to a session being registered.
   * <p>
   * To push session event messages to a client through its session upon registration, state machines can
   * use an asynchronous callback or schedule a callback to send a message.
   * <pre>
   *   {@code
   *   public void onOpen(RaftSession session) {
   *     executor.execute(() -> session.publish("foo", "Hello world!"));
   *   }
   *   }
   * </pre>
   * Sending a session event message in an asynchronous callback allows the server time to register the session
   * and notify the client before the event message is sent. Published event messages sent via this method will
   * be sent the next time an operation is applied to the state machine.
   *
   * @param session The session that was registered. State machines <em>cannot</em> {@link Session#publish(PrimitiveEvent)} session
   *                events to this session.

  /**
   * Called when a session is expired by the system.
   * <p>
   * This method is called when a client fails to keep its session alive with the cluster. If the leader hasn't heard
   * from a client for a configurable time interval, the leader will expire the session to free the related memory.
   * This method will always be called for a given session before {@link #onClose(Session)}, and {@link #onClose(Session)}
   * will always be called following this method.
   * <p>
   * State machines are free to {@link Session#publish(PrimitiveEvent)} session event messages to any session except
   * the one that expired. Session event messages sent to the session that expired will be lost since the session is closed once this
   * method call completes.
   *
   * @param session The session that was expired. State machines <em>cannot</em> {@link Session#publish(PrimitiveEvent)} session
   *                events to this session.
