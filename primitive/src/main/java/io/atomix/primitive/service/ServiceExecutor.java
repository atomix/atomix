/**
 * Facilitates registration and execution of state machine commands and provides deterministic scheduling.
 * <p>
 * The state machine executor is responsible for managing input to and output from a {@link PrimitiveService}.
 * As operations are committed to the Raft log, the executor is responsible for applying them to the state machine.
 * {@link OperationType#COMMAND commands} are guaranteed to be applied to the state machine in the order in which
 * they appear in the Raft log and always in the same thread, so state machines don't have to be thread safe.
 * {@link OperationType#QUERY queries} are not generally written to the Raft log and will instead be applied according
 * to their {@link Consistency}.
 * <p>
 * State machines can use the executor to provide deterministic scheduling during the execution of command callbacks.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   private Object putWithTtl(Commit<PutWithTtl> commit) {
 *     map.put(commit.operation().key(), commit);
 *     executor.schedule(Duration.ofMillis(commit.operation().ttl()), () -> {
 *       map.remove(commit.operation().key()).close();
 *     });
 *   }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * As with all state machine callbacks, the executor will ensure scheduled callbacks are executed sequentially and
 * deterministically. As long as state machines schedule callbacks deterministically, callbacks will be executed
 * deterministically. Internally, the state machine executor triggers callbacks based on various timestamps in the
 * Raft log. This means the scheduler is dependent on internal or user-defined operations being written to the log.
 * Prior to the execution of a command, any expired scheduled callbacks will be executed based on the command's
 * logged timestamp.
 * <p>
 * It's important to note that callbacks can only be scheduled during {@link PrimitiveOperation} operations or by recursive
 * scheduling. If a state machine attempts to schedule a callback via the executor during the execution of a
 * query, a {@link IllegalStateException} will be thrown. This is because queries are usually only applied
 * on a single state machine within the cluster, and so scheduling callbacks in reaction to query execution would
 * not be deterministic.
