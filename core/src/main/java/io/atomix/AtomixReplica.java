/**
 * Provides an interface for creating and operating on {@link io.atomix.resource.Resource}s as a stateful node.
 * <p>
 * Replicas serve as a hybrid {@link AtomixClient} and server to allow a server to be embedded
 * in an application. From the perspective of state, replicas behave like servers in that they
 * maintain a replicated state machine for {@link io.atomix.resource.Resource}s and fully participate in the underlying
 * consensus algorithm. From the perspective of resources, replicas behave like {@link AtomixClient}s in that
 * they may themselves create and modify distributed resources.
 * <p>
 * To create a replica, use the {@link #builder(Address)} builder factory. Each replica must
 * be initially configured with a replica {@link Address} and a list of addresses for other members of the
 * core cluster. Note that the list of member addresses does not have to include the local replica nor does
 * it have to include all the replicas in the cluster. As long as the replica can reach one live member of
 * the cluster, it can join.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   List<Address> members = Arrays.asList(new Address("123.456.789.0", 5000), new Address("123.456.789.1", 5000));
 *   Atomix atomix = AtomixReplica.builder(address, members)
 *     .withTransport(new NettyTransport())
 *     .withStorage(new Storage(StorageLevel.MEMORY))
 *     .build();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * Replicas must be configured with a {@link Transport} and {@link Storage}. By default, if no transport is
 * configured, the {@code NettyTransport} will be used and will thus be expected to be available on the classpath.
 * Similarly, if no storage module is configured, replicated commit logs will be written to
 * {@code System.getProperty("user.dir")} with a default log name.
 * <h2>Storage</h2>
 * Replicas manage resource and replicate and store resource state changes on disk. In order to do so, users
 * must configure the replica's {@link Storage} configuration via the {@link Builder#withStorage(Storage)} method.
 * Storage does not have to be identical on all replicas, but it is important to the desired level of fault-tolerance,
 * consistency, and performance. Users can configure where and how state changes are stored by configuring the
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.StorageLevel}.
 * <pre>
 *   {@code
 *   Atomix atomix = AtomixReplica.builder(address, members)
 *     .withTransport(new NettyTransport())
 *     .withStorage(Storage.builder()
 *       .withDirectory(new File("logs"))
 *       .withStorageLevel(StorageLevel.MAPPED)
 *       .withMaxSegmentSize(1024 * 1024)
 *       .build())
 *     .build();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * For the strongest level of consistency, it's recommended that users use the
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.StorageLevel#DISK DISK} storage level. For the greatest mix of consistency
 * and performance, the {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.StorageLevel#MAPPED MAPPED} storage level uses memory
 * mapped files to persist state changes. The {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.StorageLevel#MEMORY MEMORY}
 * storage level is recommended only for testing. Atomix cannot guarantee writes will not be lost with {@code MEMORY}
 * based logs. If a majority of the active replicas in the cluster are lost or partitioned, writes can be overwritten.
 * Using memory-based storage amounts to recreating the entire replica each time it's started.
 * <h2>Replica lifecycle</h2>
 * When the replica is {@link #bootstrap() started}, the replica will attempt to contact members in the configured
 * startup {@link Address} list. If any of the members are already in an active state, the replica will request
 * to join the cluster. During the process of joining the cluster, the replica will notify the current cluster
 * leader of its existence. If the leader already knows about the joining replica, the replica will immediately
 * join and become a full voting member. If the joining replica is not yet known to the rest of the cluster,
 * it will join the cluster in a <em>passive</em> state in which it receives replicated state from other
 * replicas in the cluster but does not participate in elections or other quorum-based aspects of the
 * underlying consensus algorithm. Once the joining replica is caught up with the rest of the cluster, the
 * leader will promote it to a full voting member.
 * <p>
 * Once the replica has joined the cluster, it will persist the updated cluster configuration to disk via
 * the replica's configured {@link Storage} module. This is important to note as in the event that the replica
 * crashes, <em>the replica will recover from its last known configuration</em> rather than the configuration
 * provided to the {@link #builder(Address) builder factory}. This allows Atomix cluster structures
 * to change transparently and independently of the code that configures any given replica. If a persistent
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.storage.StorageLevel} is used, user code should simply configure the replica
 * consistently based on the <em>initial</em> replica configuration, and the replica will recover from the last
 * known cluster configuration in the event of a failure.
