/**
 * A distributed, strongly consistent map whose methods are all executed asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * This map offers strong read-after-update (where update == create/update/delete)
 * consistency. All operations to the map are serialized and applied in a consistent
 * manner.
 * <p>
 * The stronger consistency comes at the expense of availability in
 * the event of a network partition. A network partition can be either due to
 * a temporary disruption in network connectivity between participating nodes
 * or due to a node being temporarily down.
 * </p><p>
 * All values stored in this map are {@link Versioned versioned} and the API
 * supports optimistic concurrency by allowing conditional updates that take into
 * consideration the version or value that was previously read.
 * </p><p>
 * This map does not allow null values. All methods can throw a ConsistentMapException
 * (which extends {@code RuntimeException}) to indicate failures.
 * <p>
 * All methods of this interface return a {@link CompletableFuture future} immediately
 * after a successful invocation. The operation itself is executed asynchronous and
 * the returned future will be {@link CompletableFuture#complete completed} when the
 * operation finishes.
