 * to all active subscribers in the order in which they are published.

 * Transient disruptions in communication such as occasional message drops are automatically handled
 * and recovered from without loss of delivery guarantees.
 * <p>
 * However, subscribers need to remain active or alive for these guarantees to apply. A subscriber that is
 * partitioned away for an extended duration (typically 5 seconds or more) will be marked as inactive and
 * during that period of inactivity will be removed from the list of current subscribers.
