/**
 * Distributed Work Queue primitive.
 * <p>
 * Work queue serves as a buffer allowing producers to {@link #addMultiple(Collection) add} tasks and consumers
 * to {@link #take() take} tasks to process.
 * <p>
 * In the system each task is tracked via its unique task identifier which is returned when a task is taken.
 * Work queue guarantees that a task can be taken by only one consumer at a time. Once it finishes processing a
 * consumer must invoke the {@link #complete(Collection) complete} method to mark the task(s) as completed.
 * Tasks thus completed are removed from the queue. If a consumer unexpectedly terminates before it can complete
 * all its tasks are returned back to the queue so that other consumers can pick them up. Since there is a distinct
 * possibility that tasks could be processed more than once (under failure conditions), care should be taken to ensure
 * task processing logic is idempotent.
 *
