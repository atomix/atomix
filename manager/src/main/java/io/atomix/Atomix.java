/**
 * Base type for creating and managing distributed {@link AbstractResource resources} in a Atomix cluster.
 * <p>
 * Resources are user provided stateful objects backed by a distributed state machine. This class facilitates the
 * creation and management of {@link AbstractResource} objects via a filesystem like interface. There is a
 * one-to-one relationship between keys and resources, so each key can be associated with one and only one resource.
 * <p>
 * To create a resource, pass the resource {@link java.lang.Class} to the {@link Atomix#create(String, Class)} method.
 * When a resource is created, the {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.StateMachine} associated with the resource will be created on each Raft server
 * and future operations submitted for that resource will be applied to the state machine. Internally, resource state
 * machines are multiplexed across a shared Raft log.
 * <p>
 * {@link AbstractResource} implementations serve as a user-friendly interface through which to submit
 * {@link io.atomix.copycat.client.Command commands} and {@link io.atomix.copycat.client.Query queries} to the underlying
 * {@link CopycatClient} client.
