/**
 * Base class for fault-tolerant stateful distributed objects.
 * <p>
 * Resources are stateful distributed objects that run across a set of {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.CopycatServer}s
 * in a cluster.
 * <p>
 * Resources can be created either as standalone {@link io.atomix.copycat.server.StateMachine}s in
 * a typical Copycat cluster or as {@code Atomix} resources. Operations on the resource are translated into
 * {@link Command}s and {@link Query}s which are submitted to the cluster where they're logged and
 * replicated.
 * <p>
 * Resource implementations must be annotated with the {@link ResourceTypeInfo} annotation to indicate the
 * {@link ResourceStateMachine} to be used by the Atomix resource manager. Additionally, resources must be
 * registered via the {@code ServiceLoader} pattern in a file at {@code META-INF/services/io.atomix.resource.Resource}
 * on the class path. The resource registration allows the Atomix resource manager to locate and load the resource
 * state machine on each server in the cluster.
