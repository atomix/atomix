**A reactive Java framework for building fault-tolerant distributed systems**

Please see the [website][Website] for full documentation.

Atomix 3.0 is a fully featured framework for building fault-tolerant distributed systems. It provides a set of high-level primitives commonly needed for building scalable and fault-tolerant distributed systems. These primitives include:
* Cluster management and failure detection
* Direct and publish-subscribe messaging
* Distributed coordination primitives built on a novel implementation of the [Raft][Raft] consensus protocol
* Scalable data primitives built on a multi-primary protocol
* Synchronous and asynchronous Java APIs
* Standalone agent
* REST API
