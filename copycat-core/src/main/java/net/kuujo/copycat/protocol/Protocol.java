 * CopyCat protocol.<p>
 *
 * Protocols are used by CopyCat to communicate between replicas.
 * CopyCat's protocol implementation is pluggable, meaning users can
 * use any protocol they wish to facilitate communication between nodes.
 * To register a protocol, simply create a file at
 * <code>META-INF/services/net/kuujo/copycat/protocol</code>. Name the
 * file the same name as the protocol, e.g. <code>tcp</code>. CopyCat
 * will use the protocol based on URIs used in cluster configurations.
