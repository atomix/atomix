/**
 * CopyCat endpoint.<p>
 *
 * Endpoints are user-facing interfaces that can be used to
 * send commands to a CopyCat cluster. When an endpoint receives
 * a request, if the current node is the cluster leader then the
 * command will be submitted to the cluster. If the current node
 * is not the cluster leader then the leader will be returned
 * to the client. This allows clients to locate the cluster leader.<p>
 *
 * Endpoints are defined via the CopyCat services API. To define a
 * new endpoint service, create a file in
 * <code>META-INF/services/net/kuujo/copycat/endpoints</code>. The
 * file name is the service name, and the file should contain the
 * name of a class that implements <code>Endpoint</code>.
